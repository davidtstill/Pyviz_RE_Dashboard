# Pyviz_RE_Dashboard

The analysis looks at real estate data for various neighborhoods in San Francisco. After gathering the data, a dashboard was created that would allow potential real estate investors to examine the characteristics of these submarkets. 

The first file, rental_analysis.ipynb, pulls in in the real estate information for the San Francisco real estate market. I created a DataFrame that groups the data by year and neighborhood and examined sales price/sqft, number of housing units, and gross rent. 

The second file, dashboard.ipynb, converts the plot objects to a Panel pane. I then create functions that Panel can use to create an interactive dashboard.
